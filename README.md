# Setup_my_workstation

Contains scripts to automate setup of a new macbook or a new linux-box. These scripts are based on my requirements over the years, but you can probably use them as starting points to build more complex setups. 

The mac setup script is somewhat constrained by my limited memory (128 GB) macbook, so I refrain from installing things like the ~ 4 GB texlive distribution.
